        <p> <B>What Is Bruschetta?</B></p>
        <p> Bruschetta (pronounced brew-SKET-tah) is an Italian appetizer or antipasti 
            <br>that starts with a base of toasted or grilled bread. The bread is then served
            <br> warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so 
            <br>each person can build their own bruschetta. Bruschetta is meant to be served 
            <br>as a hand-held finger food, large enough for one or two bites.</p>

            <p> <b>Best Bread for Bruschetta</b></p>
            <p> The best bread for bruschetta has a sturdy crust and is firm enough
                <br> to hold the bruschetta topping. Choose a loaf of Italian bread, such
                <br> as ciabatta, for a more traditional bruschetta. This recipe uses 
                <br>slices of French bread, like a baguette. Slice the bread on the
                <br>  diagonal at least ¼-inch thick or more to make an oval shape.</p>
            <p> <b>Ingredients</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 loaf French bread, cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>8 roma (plum) tomatoes, diced</li>
                    <li> ⅓ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
                    <li>1 ounce Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon good quality balsamic vinegar</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
